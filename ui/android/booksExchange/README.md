## Client Features (`bex-droid`)

- **Barcode & ISBN Scanner**: Embedded ZXing image processing pipeline capable of scanning ISBN barcodes via the device camera (`CaptureActivity`, `DecodeThread`, `QRCodeEncoder`).
- **Google Books Integration**: Automatically queries the Google Books API (`GoogleBooksStore.java`) upon barcode capture to fetch title, author, description, and cover artwork.
- **Virtual Bookshelf Display**: Custom 2D shelf rendering (`ShelvesView.java`) with smooth transitions and spotlight effects.
- **Local Cache & Content Provider**: `BooksProvider` manages local persistence using SQLite and content provider URIs.

---

## Server Architecture (`bex-engine`)

- **Google App Engine Java Runtime**: High-concurrency cloud endpoints serving user book catalogs, exchange requests, and matching.
- **RESTful API**: Serves JSON endpoints consumed by the `bex-droid` mobile client.

## Technical Highlights

- **Proximity Discovery**: Matches users with nearby points of interest, events, and peers using GPS and cellular triangulation coordinates.
- **XMPP Instant Messaging**: Integrates the Smack XMPP protocol library to power real-time peer-to-peer chats directly after mutual discovery matches.
- **Testing via Mock Location Provider**: Supports development and testing through mock GPS KML traces pushed to the emulator filesystem (`/data/misc/location/mobeegal`).
- **Web Portal (`mobeegal.in`)**: Serves as the landing page and registration gateway.

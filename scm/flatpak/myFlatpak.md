A new world for application developers

Stable platforms

Runtimes provide platforms of common libraries that you can depend on.
Consistent environments

Develop and test your application in an environment that’s identical to the one users have.
Full control over dependencies

Flatpak makes it easy to bundle your own libraries as part of your app.
Easy build tools

Flatpak’s build tools are simple and easy to use, and come with a full set of documentation.
Future-proof builds

Flatpak apps continue to be compatible with new versions of Linux distributions.
Distribution made easy

Make your app available to a rapidly growing audience of Flatpak users, with Flathub.
An independent project

Flatpak is developed by an independent community, with no lock-in to a single vendor.

FROM
--
    FROM [--platform=<platform>] <image> [AS <name>]
Or

    FROM [--platform=<platform>] <image>[:<tag>] [AS <name>]
Or

    FROM [--platform=<platform>] <image>[@<digest>] [AS <name>]

The FROM instruction initializes a new build stage and sets the Base Image for subsequent instructions. As such, a valid Dockerfile must start with a FROM instruction. The image can be any valid image – it is especially easy to start by pulling an image from the Public Repositories.

- ARG is the only instruction that may precede FROM in the Dockerfile. See Understand how ARG and FROM interact.
- FROM can appear multiple times within a single Dockerfile to create multiple images or use one build stage as a dependency for another. Simply make a note of the last image ID output by the commit before each new FROM instruction. Each FROM instruction clears any state created by previous instructions.
- Optionally a name can be given to a new build stage by adding AS name to the FROM instruction. The name can be used in subsequent FROM and COPY --from=<name> instructions to refer to the image built in this stage.
- The tag or digest values are optional. If you omit either of them, the builder assumes a latest tag by default. The builder returns an error if it cannot find the tag value.

The optional --platform flag can be used to specify the platform of the image in case FROM references a multi-platform image. For example, linux/amd64, linux/arm64, or windows/amd64. By default, the target platform of the build request is used. Global build arguments can be used in the value of this flag, for example automatic platform ARGs allow you to force a stage to native build platform (--platform=$BUILDPLATFORM), and use it to cross-compile to the target platform inside the stage.

Understand how ARG and FROM interact
FROM instructions support variables that are declared by any ARG instructions that occur before the first FROM.

    ARG  CODE_VERSION=latest
    FROM base:${CODE_VERSION}
    CMD  /code/run-app
    
    FROM extras:${CODE_VERSION}
    CMD  /code/run-extras

An ARG declared before a FROM is outside of a build stage, so it can’t be used in any instruction after a FROM. To use the default value of an ARG declared before the first FROM use an ARG instruction without a value inside of a build stage:

    ARG VERSION=latest
    FROM busybox:$VERSION
    ARG VERSION
    RUN echo $VERSION > image_version

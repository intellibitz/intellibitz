GNOME Desktop
--
To run the Ubuntu GNOME desktop from WSL2 Ubuntu, you’ll need to install a desktop environment and a Windows X server. Here are the steps:

Install Ubuntu on WSL2: First, ensure that you have Ubuntu installed on your WSL2. You can download it from the Microsoft Store1.

Install a Desktop Environment: Next, install a desktop environment on your Ubuntu WSL2. For GNOME, you can use the following command:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop

Install a Windows X Server: An X server is needed to display the graphical interface of your Linux apps on Windows. Examples of X servers you can use are VcXsrv, X410, and Xming.

Configure Display Settings: In your Ubuntu terminal, add the following line to the end of your ~/.bashrc file:

    export DISPLAY=$(awk '/nameserver / {print $2; exit}' /etc/resolv.conf 2>/dev/null):0
    export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1

Then, source the ~/.bashrc file:

    source ~/.bashrc

Run the Desktop Environment: You can now run the GNOME desktop environment with the command:

    gnome-session

Please note that running a full desktop environment can be resource-intensive and might not work perfectly. For most use cases, running individual GUI apps is recommended.

Grub Cant Load Windows After Upgrade
After upgrading Ubuntu, you may encounter issues with GRUB not loading Windows ~Windows 10 or 11~ in a
 dual-boot setup. Based on the provided search results, here are some potential solutions to resolve the issue:

Modify
/etc/default/grub
Set
GRUB_TERMINAL=console
to force GRUB to use a text-based terminal instead of graphics mode. This might resolve the issue.
Update GRUB configuration by running
sudo update-grub
sudo update-grub2
 after modifying the file.

Use os-prober:
Ensure os-prober is installed and configured correctly. You can check its status by running
sudo os-prober --debug.
~If os-prober detects Windows but GRUB doesn’t, try adding a custom GRUB menu entry using the
 menuentry command ~e.g., menuentry "Windows 7" { ... }~.

Review BIOS/UEFI settings:
Ensure that UEFI boot is enabled and set to prioritize the Windows Boot Manager ~if applicable~.
Check the boot order in your BIOS/UEFI settings to ensure Ubuntu is set to boot after Windows.

Disable Secure Boot:
Disable Secure Boot in Windows 10/11 to allow GRUB to boot Windows.

Use grub-customizer:
Install grub-customizer using the PPA repository
~sudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer and
sudo apt update~.
Run
sudo grub-customizer
to edit GRUB settings and configure boot options.

Check for NTFS issues:
Run chkdsk ~Check Disk~ on the Windows partition to ensure NTFS is healthy and repair any issues.

Reinstall GRUB:
~If all else fails, you can try reinstalling GRUB using sudo grub-install /dev/sda ~replace /dev/sda with your Windows partition device~.

Additional Tips:
Ensure you have the correct UUID for your Windows partition when creating custom GRUB menu entries.
~If you have multiple Ubuntu installations, ensure that the GRUB configuration file is updated correctly.
Consider reinstalling Ubuntu or resetting the GRUB configuration to its default state if none of the above solutions work.
Remember to backup your data and system configuration before attempting any changes. ~If you’re still experiencing issues,
 you may want to seek further assistance from online forums or Ubuntu support resources.

Check GRUB boot order: Ensure that Windows is set as the default boot option in GRUB. You can do this by:
Restarting your computer and pressing the key to enter the GRUB boot menu ~usually F2, F12, or Del~.
Selecting “Advanced Options” or “Boot Options” and adjusting the boot order to prioritize Windows.
Saving the changes and restarting your computer.
